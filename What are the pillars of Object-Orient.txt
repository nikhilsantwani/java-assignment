What are the pillars of Object-Oriented Programming? Explain each one.
What is the difference between composition and inheritance?

Key Differences:

Relationship: Composition represents a "has-a" relationship, while inheritance represents an "is-a" relationship.
Flexibility: Composition offers more flexibility because it allows objects to be composed of different components, which can vary independently. Inheritance establishes a fixed relationship between classes.
Code Reusability: Both composition and inheritance promote code reuse, but composition is generally considered more flexible and preferable when code reuse is the primary concern.
Encapsulation: Composition often encapsulates objects within a class, whereas inheritance exposes the structure of the superclass to its subclasses.

How does Java support multiple inheritance?
What is method overloading? Can you provide an example?
Method overloading is a feature in object-oriented programming languages where you can define multiple methods in the same class with the same name but with different parameters. The compiler or interpreter determines which method to execute based on the number, type, and order of the parameters passed to it.

How does method overriding differ from method overloading? Provide an example.

what is defalt method ?
 A default method is a method declared within an interface using the default keyword. It provides a default implementation for the method, allowing classes that implement the interface to inherit the implementation without having to provide their own.
